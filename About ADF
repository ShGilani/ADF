ADF implements MVC:

View (UI) -------------> Controller (Task Flows) -----------> Model (Bindings, Data Controls) --------------> Business Services (ADF BC)  ----> Data Services (DB) 

Business Services do two things in a case of ADF BC -- read and write data to our data services and implement business logic. 

We use task flows to represent a logical group of pages, a logical activity. 
You could think of like a use case. And a logical set of pages and methods that we do to carry out a certain activity.

Entity objects represent tables, and they're what we use to write to the database. Associations represent the foreign key connections between tables. 
So it should be part of the entity package.

The view object represent the custom view of the data necessary for the user interface. View links are the association that we expose to the client side.

application module acts as our facade. It exposes only view objects and view links.

We have a separate project for the model and a separate project for the view controller.
The view controller project holds ADF Faces and ADF Controller, and this is the UI portion of the application.
